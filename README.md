Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/uqbar-project/wollok/wiki/Home) for documentation like Language Reference and Environment.

## What's the language like ? ##

* Object Oriented
* Non "class-centered". Allows you to create objects as first-class citizens without the need of classes. To start working with objects without introducing complex subjects and mechanisms as hierarchies, overriding methods, etc.
* Tries to maximize compile-time checks while keeping the power of a dynamic language.
* With implicit types: by means of a type system and type inference mechanism.
* A clean syntax avoiding unnecessary symbols (java) while keeping it simple and even familiar for those who already have some experience in programming) 
* Interpreted: means that the code is being evaluated as it's being read.

## How is the Environment ? ##

* Completely integrated with Eclipse.
* Compile-time errors reporting.
* Checks and Quick-Fixes.
* Integrated Console.
* Integrated Outline.
* Integrated with eclipse Launchers (Run As).
* A debugger.
